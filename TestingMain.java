        // Step 0: Declare a String object with the value "Hello World"
        // You can name the reference anything you want
         String r1 = "Hi";


        // Step 1: Call length()
        // Q1. What do you expect the number printed is? Count carefully!
        // Q2. Call the method and print the result. Does it include spaces?



        // Step 2: Call indexOf("H")
        // Q4. What index is printed for "W"?
        // Q5. What happens if you search for "w"? Why is the answer different?
        // Q6. What happens if the letter is not found at all?
        // Q7. What is the index of the first letter?



        // Step 3: Call substring(8)
        // Q7. What is printed when you use one parameter in substring?
        // Q8. Which index does it start at, and where does it stop?
        // Q9. What do you expect substring(s.length()) would print?



        // Step 4: Call substring(1,3)
        // Q10. What is printed with two parameters?
        // Q11. Does the second parameter’s index get included or excluded?
        // Q12. Predict what happens if you flip them (substring(3,1)) —
        //       Will it work, or cause an error? Why?




        // Additional Question:
        // Declare a String object with the value "null" <- String x = null;
        // Try some of the methods on this object, what do you get?
        // What does the error say?

     }
